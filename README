git-itemize: compose commit message interactively

This script provides an interface similar to 'git commit --interactive'
for writing commit messages.  It displays each staged hunk and prompts the
user for a one-line summary. Pressing 'enter' skips the current hunk.
The set of summarized changes is then opened in $EDITOR so that it may be
revised or expanded.

Requires pygit2: <http://www.pygit2.org/>
